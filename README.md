# SEARCH-ENGINE-PROJECT_1
 
I have developed a search engine that uses the Wikipedia XML dataset to retrieve relevant results based on user queries. The engine is built using natural language processing techniques and information retrieval objectives. Users can input their search query and the engine parses through the entire XML file to display relevant results.

Changes:
- Caching added
- Faster Query Results
- MultiThreading Enabled
- Improved Indexing Time
